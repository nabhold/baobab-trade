The audit found no reason to replace Medusa or duplicate native commerce modules. The main recurring risk is a policy wrapper that native Medusa routes can bypass; each remaining Gate must either hook the native workflow or prove the only allowed entry point is enforced server-side.

For every Gate: branch from current `main`; update code, tests, CI and documentation together; run formatting, lint, type-check, unit tests, build and Gate integration checks; open exactly one Gate PR; review the diff and unresolved threads; require all checks to succeed; squash-merge; then refresh `main` before starting the next Gate. A failed Gate blocks later Gates—commerce has enough ghosts without manufacturing new ones.
