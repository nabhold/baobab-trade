# Market model: Baobab Market vs. Medusa Region

Governing decision: `docs/adr/ADR-0010_ MedusaJS Commerce Market, Region,
Currency, Sales Channel and Legal Seller Model.md`.

## The distinction

A **Baobab Market** is a Control Plane canonical concept: a governed
commercial operating context (`nabhold/shared`
`contracts/control-plane/v1/market.schema.json`). It carries a country/
currency policy, a legal seller, tax/pricing/catalogue/payment/fulfilment
policy references, and a lifecycle (`DRAFT → VALIDATED → ACTIVE → …`).

A **Medusa Region** is Trade's local commerce-execution mechanism: a
currency, a set of countries, payment providers and tax behaviour. Trade
provisions one Region (plus a Sales Channel and Stock Location) as its
projection of a Market. The two are never assumed equal:

- one Market may span multiple countries or Regions;
- Country, Currency, Sales Channel, Digital Estate, Legal Seller and
  EngineInstance are each explicitly **not** synonyms for Market
  (ADR-0010 §95-§101).

Trade reads Market configuration from the Control Plane
(`GET /v1/markets/{market_id}` — `HttpControlPlaneClient.getMarket`) and never
authors or redefines it locally.

## Current state: no Market instance exists yet

`nabhold/shared` `contracts/legal-entity/registry.yaml` records the
`ZURIBEANS` legal entity with `markets: []`, explicitly deferred until the
canonical Market, Region and domain contract is approved and a market is
registered through `POST /v1/markets`. That has not happened for Uganda or
South Africa.

This repository therefore drives its own Medusa-side provisioning from
**candidate market keys** defined in `src/baobab/market/market-config.ts`
(`zuribeans_ug`, `zuribeans_za`) rather than a `market_id` it would otherwise
have to invent. Once Control Plane registers and activates the real Markets,
the resulting `market_id` must be reconciled against the local
`baobab_market_key` breadcrumb (see below) — this repository does not do that
reconciliation automatically yet.

## Engine-native mapping breadcrumb (not the canonical mapping)

`src/baobab/market/mapping.ts` tags each Medusa Region, Sales Channel and
Stock Location's own `metadata` with `{ baobab_market_key, baobab_mapping_authority: "trade-engine-native-pending-control-plane-registration" }`.
This is deliberately **not** the canonical mapping record described in
`contracts/control-plane/v1/canonical-mapping.schema.json` — that record is
minted and owned by Control Plane. The local tag exists only so
`npm run bootstrap:market` is idempotent (safe to re-run) and so a future
reconciliation job can find what Trade already provisioned.

Gate 4 binds Medusa's system payment, tax, and manual fulfilment providers so
the projections are executable without pretending that a production provider
has been approved. Each Market has an independent provider-policy object.
Jurisdictional tax percentages, shipping prices, and cross-border rules are
not seeded here; later gates must source them from governed policy.

## Running the bootstrap

```bash
npm run bootstrap:market            # provisions both launch Markets
medusa exec ./src/scripts/bootstrap-market.ts zuribeans_ug   # one Market only
```

The script is idempotent: re-running it detects already-provisioned records
by deterministic metadata or names and leaves them untouched. It provisions
Medusa Regions, the shared B2B Sales Channel, Stock Locations, Store currency
support, Tax Regions, country Service Zones, and provider links. It does not
seed products, orders, tax percentages, or shipping prices.
